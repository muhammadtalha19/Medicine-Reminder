💊 Medicine Reminder App
Developed by Muhammad Talha, this web-based Progressive Web App (PWA) helps users manage their medication schedule efficiently. Users can input medicine names, quantities, and specific times — and the app handles the rest by sending reminders, tracking doses, and even working offline.
